# self-study
Self-study practice problems and projects in computer science

## Motivation
To make up for a lack of formal computer science education, and to fill any gaps in my abilities as a software engineer, I've begun a review and organized self-study of fundamental computer science topics.

I'll focus on reading computer science textbooks, completing problem sets within these books (stored in this repository), and auditing computer science courses at my university (Texas A&M). My reading list is derived from online resources (especially [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)) and course syllabi.


## Current reading list
1. [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) (Abelson and Sussman): formal review of program structures, computer interpretation of programs, abstraction, modularity; expanding into study of register machines, low-level memory operations, and compilers. Learning Lisp.
2. [Discrete Mathematics and its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Its-Applications-Seventh/dp/0073383090) (Rosen): Brief mathematical review of formal logic and other useful concepts.
3. [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275) (Goodrich, Tamassia and Goldwasser). Formal introduction to data structures and algorithm analysis, with a focus on Python.

## Supplemental material
- [Data Structures and Algorithms in C++](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/0470383275) (Goodrich, Tamassia and Mount). Learning C++ through online guides and supplementing my learning process with analysis of example code and practice problems from this book.
- [Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0198739834/) (Nick Bostrom).
